# pollevbot

**pollevbot** is a bot that automatically responds to polls on [pollev.com](https://pollev.com/). 
It continually checks if a specified host has opened any polls. Once a poll has been opened, 
it submits a random response. 

Requires Python 3.7 or later.
## Dependencies

[Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/), 
[BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/). 

[APScheduler](https://pypi.org/project/APScheduler/) to deploy to Heroku.

## Usage

Install `pollevbot`:
```
pip install pollevbot
```

Set your username, password, and desired poll host:
```python
user = 'My Username'
password = 'My Password'
host = 'PollEverywhere URL Extension e.g. "uwpsych"'
```

And run the script.
```python
from pollevbot import PollBot

user = 'My Username'
password = 'My Password'
host = 'PollEverywhere URL Extension e.g. "uwpsych"'

# If you're using a non-UW PollEv account,
# add the argument "login_type='pollev'"
with PollBot(user, password, host) as bot:
    bot.run()
```
Alternatively, you can clone this repo, set your login credentials in 
[main.py](pollevbot/main.py) and run it from there.
